# NBA-Player-ShotChart-Analysis

Please see Kobe Every Shot Ever-checkpoint.ipynb for code. Original file was compromised.

This graphic shows a complete collection of all shot attempts by NBA Superstar, Kobe Bryant.

The inspiration for this project comes from this LA Times graphic: https://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/


This graphic displays every make and miss by Bryant during his NBA career. The graphic was made using Jupyter Notebooks and python libraries including pandas and numpy to manipulate the data and visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn to plot the chart

Aiming to add interactive hovertools to portray every shot's statistic but didn't get to it this time around.

In the future, this interactive tool would allow users to hover their cursor over any of the data points and get additonal info about the point such as shot type, against what team, season. We could even analyze shot accuracy for NBA players and determine from what areas on the court they make the most shots.
