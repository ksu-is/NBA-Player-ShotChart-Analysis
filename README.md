# NBA-Player-ShotChart-Analysis

This graphic shows a complete collection of all shot attempts by NBA Superstar, Kobe Bryant.

The inspiration for this project comes from this LA Times graphic: https://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/


This graphic displays every make and miss by Bryant during his NBA career. The graphic was made using Jupyter Notebooks and python libraries including pandas and numpy to manipulate the data and visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn to plot the chart

Once we scraped the data, we exported a csv and translated the x and y coordinates to latitude and longitude.

We did a very simple translation from X and Y coordinates to latitude and longitude. 
Add new columns in Panda so the court is evenly displayed
